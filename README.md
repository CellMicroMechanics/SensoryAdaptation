# SensoryAdaptation
The code for this project is written in Matlab. In order to run, uncomment the code block of interest in the main.m file and run.
The main.m file can run two different simulations. 
The first plots the energy-accuracy plot with respect to variations in chemical potential "beta" and yields an exponentially decaying function.
The second plots the linear energy-accuracy relation which is obtained by variation in the input s.
The file gen_traj.m is used to generate the realizations of the stochastic system.
